# BSFfast

BSFfast is a lightweight numerical tool providing precomputed effective
bound-state formation (BSF) cross sections for annihilation processes
in the early Universe.

This repository accompanies the paper:

**BSFfast: Rapid computation of bound-state effects on annihilation in the early Universe**

The code provides tabulated effective BSF cross sections and interpolation
routines for use in Boltzmann solvers.

Documentation and usage examples will be extended.
